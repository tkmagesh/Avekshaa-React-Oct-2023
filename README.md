## HTML vs JSX
### JSX
- Every tag MUST have an close tag
- Use "htmlFor" in place of "for" attribute
- Use "className" in place of "class" attribute

## Component
- Encapsulates Presentation (JSX) + User Interaction logic (events) + State (useState)
- Reusable

## ES Modules
- Everything defined in a js/jsx file is by default considered PRIVATE to the file
- Any public entity has to be explicity EXPORTED
- Any public entity has to be explicity IMPORTED to use them
